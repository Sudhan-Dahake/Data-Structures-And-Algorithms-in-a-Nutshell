Do we need to keep a tail pointer in the ADT?
```

```
For singly linked lists, maintaining a tail pointer is not strictly mandatory;
its necessity depends on the specific use case and the developer's requirements.
However, having a tail pointer can significantly improve efficiency, allowing
operations like removing or adding elements at the end of the list to be done in
O(1) time. Without a tail pointer, such operations would require iterating from
the head to the last element, which takes O(n) time. While it's optional, including
a tail pointer is generally a good practice for enhancing performance in scenarios
involving frequent end-of-list operations.
